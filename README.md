# Process Creation and Communication

This repository contains the implementation of a C program for creating and communicating processes using shared memory. It calculates the value of Pi using two different series - Gregory-Leibniz and Nilakantha - to demonstrate the inter-process communication and shared memory management in a Linux environment.

## Objectives
- Familiarize with process programming, creation, and communication.
- Creation, writing, and reading of Shared Memory.

## Tools Used
- Linux Operating System.
- GCC Compiler.
- C Programming Language.
- Creation of processes, creation, writing, and reading of POSIX Shared Memory in C.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Folder containing the source code files.
- `README.md`: This file, containing project description and instructions.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `src/` folder.
3. Compile the program using the command: `gcc main.c -o main -lrt`
4. Run the compiled program with an integer parameter N: `./main N`
